## Purpose

This page is the central academic and technical resource index for EpiPulse. It is designed to support research quality, reproducibility, ethics, and implementation readiness across all internal divisions.

## Academic Objective

EpiPulse resources are developed to:

- Strengthen protocol-to-publication research workflows
- Improve evidence quality in public health decision-making
- Build practical skills in epidemiology, analytics, and implementation
- Standardize documentation, data governance, and reproducibility
- Support collaborative work across research, program, and systems teams

## Core Resource Collection

- [AI-assisted Data Cleaning Workflow](ai_with_r.qmd)  
  Practical R workflow for de-identified AI-assisted data cleaning, typing, labeling, and export.

- [Community](community.qmd)  
  Discussion space for technical questions, peer support, and method exchange.

- [Transparency](transparency.qmd)  
  Legal structure, governance framework, and pre-launch operational status.
